<h1>Introduction of Paragraph tag</h1>

<p>
    In HTML, paragraphs are defined with the p tag.<br>
    A paragraph element in an HTML document is made up of content<br>
    such as text, images, or other content<br>
    which appears between an opening p tag and closing p tag.<br>
</p>

<p>
    p tag is the HTML tag for a paragraph. Adding the p tag to an HTML doc, <br>
    followed by text, will create a paragraph on your page. <br>
    Adding the closing p tag will end the paragraph.<br>
